BattleAntz
==========

A RTS without micromanagment.


###Storyline
You and your colony have settled in a family’s backyard with dreams of conquering the neighborhood. Once you’ve finally gotten comfortable, word spreads that your colony has hit the sweet spot for all things sweet. A jealous queen with no home hears about your colony and  decides she deserves to rule your colony and plans a takeover. And so, the invasion begins...


###Gameplay
At the beginning of the game you, as the player, start with a hive to defend and a small stockpile of resources. The object of the game is to defend your hive by defeating the opposing brood. To do this, you must manage gathering resources, growing your brood, and attacking the enemy.

The layout of the backyard you’re fighting for is your hive on one side, and the enemy queen and her brood on the other. between the two is a single, straight lane that will be the battlefield for fighting units. There will also be a side lane that leads to resources to be gathered by both you and your enemy. The map will be shrouded in a “fog of war” that allows you to see only the map terrain, but not enemy units. This fog of war is lifted in areas on the map based on where your units currently are. 

Resources, in the form of sugar, are used to build units and purchase upgrades. Sugar is obtained in two ways. First, your hive automatically generates sugar 10 sugar per second automatically. You can upgrade the rate of this accumulation during the course of the game. Secondly, you can build worker ants to go collect sugar from an infinite stockpile available on the map. Upon reaching the stockpile, these workers will accumulate sugar at a given rate. You can also upgrade the rate of workers’ sugar accumulation. Your workers and enemy workers can both gather from the sugar stockpile without conflict. 

When you spend sugar to build units at your hive, they are added into a queue. Units are spawned to the backyard when you choose, by selecting the desired amount of each available unit in your queue, then clicking the spawn button. At this point, any spawned workers proceed down the side lane toward the sugar stockpile, and soldier ants march down the center lane toward the enemy queen and her brood.

Soldier ants in the center lane will march toward the enemy at a rate based on their movement speed. When your soldier ants come into contact with the enemy’s, they will fight until all units on one or both sides are completely destroyed. If there are no enemy forces, ants will deal damage to the enemy’s hive and die.
